Welcome to Voting Portal. After creating so many serious study related tools, just for some fun we created this tool. This one is the most famous tool which got viral in our college MITACSC. Not only students were asking for the votes but also faculties were doing the same by sharing their profile link on social media. So here is the script, hope it will bring fun for the users you are using it for.

Features: 
 1. Profile with vote count and batch.
 2. Citywise filter.
 3. Search for the user.
 4. Social media sharing system.

Installation Instructions:
1. Import the mysql database file (db.sql)to your server. 
2. Open folder classes, you will find the file dbconfig.php add the database credentials
3. Open folder applications/config/, you will find database.php file and add the credentials.
4. Find 
	$config['base_url'] = '';
